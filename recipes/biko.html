    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biko, also spelled bico, is a sweet rice cake from the Philippines.</p>
    <p>It is made of coconut milk, brown sugar, and sticky rice. It is usually topped with latik (either or both the coconut curds or the syrupy caramel-like variant).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked glutinous white rice</li>
        <li>6 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut preserves (such as Phil SupremeÂ®)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice overnight in the water. </li>

        <li>Cook the soaked rice over medium heat in a saucepan with the soaking water, 1/2 can of coconut milk, and white sugar, stirring constantly, until tender and thickened, about 20 minutes. Pour into the prepared baking pan.</li>
