    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Champorado is a beloved Filipino dessert that combines rice and chocolate, resulting in a warm, comforting, and slightly sweet dish</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
        <li>2 cups light coconut milk</li>

        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine rice and light coconut milk in a large pot; bring to a boil for 10 minutes, while stirring occasionally to keep rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. </li>
